to copy and paste to and from remote servers

for local to remote,here we use scp instead of ssh
-scp -i "Webserver.pem" Resume.pdf ec2-user@ec2-13-233-67-67.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ec2-user

this can be done directly from the terminal

Now,from remote to local
-scp -i "Webserver.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-233-67-67.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ec2-user/file1.txt .
