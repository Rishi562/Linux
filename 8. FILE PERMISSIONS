There are three permissions

r-read the file
w-write to the file
x-execute the file as a shell script or a program

All combinations of permissions are only 8
r = 4 , w = 2 , x = 1


4  2  1
r  w  x     = 7
r  w  -     = 6
r  -  x     = 5
r  -  -     = 4
-  w  x     = 3
-  w  -     = 2
-  -  x     = 1
-  -  -     = 0

so chmod 777 means owner,group and other all have rwx permissions,
so 777 = -rwxrwxrwx



example 
- chmod 777 file1.txt
- chmod 600 file2.txt





-rw-rw-r--
- [group1]-             [group2]-                            [group3]--
   owner permissions    users group permissions             otherusers permissions

here the owner has read write and blank, user group has read write and blank, others have only read
