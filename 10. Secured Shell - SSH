SSH is used for remote login into remote servers.
stands for secured shell
It uses keys to access remote servers

we need a private key with us to login into a remote servers
This private key is created while creating a servers
the command is - 
-ssh-keygen
this is run when an ec2 is created, and private key is downloaded to us.

So, the public key is on the ec2 server and private with us.

if we want to login from windows to linux, we will need a ppk format. using putty
if from linux , we use .pem format.
this uses the openssh protocol

We use an sshclient to login into remote server.
Terminal can also be used as a client
1. --if we type ssh on terminal, it will show us info that it is an ssh client
2. locate the file using find command
cd ~/Downloads and ls -l
