Everything in linux is a file or a directory


arch of linux - 

1   kernal - it is the code that lets the linux work and allows processes to be executed
2   shell  - it gives the command towards the kernal which processes it

we cannot talk to kernel directly

application talks to shell
shell talks to kernal

ex - mkdir- this command runs a c equivalent code in the kernal and makes a folder on the disk

ex- touch file - this will make a file with no extension . the shell executes this command and kernel processes it 
                    on the hardware(disk)


~/ is the home directory
the first is the /
this is the root directory
everything in linux is a file or a directory
/
BIN-
all the commands that we use is stored in the bin folder
all executables are in green color,file is white and blue is directory

common user commands you use in a single user mode are stored here

SBIN - here all the commands are what are used by as system admins

refer notes for more

all users are located in /home

to goto home we can do cd ~
to goto root directory we can use cd /

tee command reads from cmdline input and writes it to the output and files
