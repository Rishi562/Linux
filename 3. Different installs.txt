Linux ubuntu is based on debian


1.Software store/package manager 
    this is pretty with GUI and done in clicks


2.Synaptic/Pamac - first we need to install this from terminal
    this shows a giant list of things
    this is very comprehensive 


3.Terminal - 
    a.sudo apt update - this refreshes our list of repositiries
    b.sudo apt install packagename
    look first if your distro uses apt or apt-get


4.Snaps/Flatpaks/Appimage - 
    Snapcraft.io/store - online store for packages,use the package name 
    to install something,use the terminal with package name
    use - sudo snap install packagename

    Appimage - Download the app image
    If we double click on it,it gives an error

    Right click on it and properties
    Then goto permissions and allow execute file as a program
    now this can be double clicked and opened right update
    Appimage is a unique format


5.Run/Manual Install - Download application,run it and manually install it
    has a format of tar
    Extract this by double clicking it
    goto the folder,copy the application file named same as package
    move mv the folder to  /opt - sudo mv brave /opt

    now goto usr/share/applications
    we have to manually create a reference point here
    create a copy of the filename and remane as package.desktop

    now this can be found in our application menu
