Grep is used to find a particualr word inside a particular file
EX - grep rishi /etc/passwd
                            Here,passwd is the file of user lst

use 
grep -i rishi /etc/passwd to ignore case sensitivity and see all occurances



Real World use - 

Application log file
It is a file which notes all the things that happens in the backend


----------
If QA team asks only Trace details in the log file,
we can grep it from the log file 
- grep TRACE application.log

Now Trace only is needed in seperate file
so,output is redirected in new file

grep TRACE application.log > trace_onlyforQA.log
now a new file will be created

Best practice is to save it in form of .log extension
