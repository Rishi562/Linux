sudo useradd -m username

-m is so that a folder of same username will be created in the home folder

now,set password for this useradd

sudo passwd username
now, set password for the user

now, we cannot switch to this user or access the folders of it.
we need to switch from current to the new

su - for switch user

su username

now,we can check it with whoami command it will switch

we can switch but cannot create something, we need to give it permissions further
